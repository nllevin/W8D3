# CSS Float Exercise

Starting from the skeleton, update the the float.css stylesheet. In this exercise, we will be updating our navbar to use the float property and create a basic fluid grid system for our main content. Let us begin. üôè

Instead of making the nav into an inline-block element, use float to put our nav in the top-right.
Just for fun, float the logo to the left and then clear-fix the vertical collapse problem.
Replace the fixed pixel widths of our aside and main content section with a fluid grid system similar to those seen in the CSS Grid System video. Add all grid rules to custom_grid.css. Note that this will require updating index.html with respective container class names.
You may need to give your recipe image a width of 100% so it expands to fit the entire figure and does not default to its natural fixed pixel width. Do this for all images by applying it to css_custom_reset.css.
